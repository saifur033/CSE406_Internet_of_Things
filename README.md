### 💡 **Final Project: IoT-Based Fingerprint Attendance System**

**Objective:**  
Develop a fingerprint-based IoT attendance system using the **ESP8266 NodeMCU** and **R307 Fingerprint Sensor**.  
The project automatically records attendance data (User ID, Date, and Time) and stores it in **Google Sheets** through a **Google Apps Script** web API.

**Features:**
- Fingerprint authentication for attendance marking  
- Automatic data upload to Google Sheets via Wi-Fi  
- **OLED display** for real-time status messages  
- **Buzzer** for sound feedback (1 beep = success, 2 beeps = denied)  
- Paperless, fast, and accurate attendance tracking system  
- Cloud-based monitoring for schools, offices, and organizations  

📂 **Folder:** [Project](./Project)  
📄 **Proposal Document:** [IoT_Fingerprint_Attendance_Project_Proposal.pdf](./Project/IoT_Fingerprint_Attendance_Project_Proposal.pdf)
